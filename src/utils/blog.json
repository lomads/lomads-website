    "content": "<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalomeBernhart\"><strong>Salome Bernhart</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>In the current era of digital advancements, data collection holds significant importance for users, connecting the virtual realm to the real world. As we interact with platforms like Google, ChatGPT and various other social media networks on a daily basis, we often provide our data and engage in activities without retaining control or ownership over the information generated. This practice raises critical questions about the value and implications of our personal data and interactions.</p>\r\n<p>Data collection not only shapes the digital landscape but also influences the services and content we encounter. Platforms analyze user behaviour, preferences, and trends to deliver personalized experiences, targeted advertisements, and relevant recommendations. However, this exchange often disadvantages users, as they relinquish their data without adequate control or compensation.</p>\r\n<h1>Tipping the Data Scales</h1>\r\n<p>People often hand over their data to companies without receiving equal value, tipping the balance in favor of the platform. This denies users control over their data, triggering concerns about privacy, security, and ethical data use.</p>\r\n<p>Privacy is paramount. Users demand secure data handling but without control, they’re in the dark about its collection and use. This opacity can result in privacy breaches, unsolicited data sharing, and misuse, exposing users to identity theft and intrusive ads. For instance, the <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html\">2021 LinkedIn debacle</a> revealed the personal data of 700 million users.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Security intertwines with privacy</strong>. Platforms’ inability to safeguard user data from breaches and cyberattacks is concerning. These breaches, unfortunately frequent, put user data in jeopardy. The 2022 <a href=\"https://www.upguard.com/blog/cost-of-data-breach\">average data breach cost</a> skyrocketed to <strong>$4.35 million</strong>, further deepening the data contribution imbalance due to users’ limited recourse.</p>\r\n<p>The advent of blockchain technology, smart contracts, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) presents an opportunity to revolutionize data handling. By emphasizing user control and data ownership, we can instil trust and inspire innovation in the digital landscape.</p>\r\n<h1>User Power in the Data Playground</h1>\r\n<p>Recognizing the significance of data ownership and control, emerging standards like <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551\">EIP-6551</a> and <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5173\">ERC-5173</a> in the Ethereum ecosystem <strong>and new privacy-focused L2 blockchains</strong>, promote principles such as <strong>data composability, portability and privacy</strong>. These standards aim to empower users by offering frameworks that enhance their control and participation in data-related activities.</p>\r\n<p>Data composability refers to the ability to combine and utilize data from various sources in a cohesive manner. It allows users to leverage their data across different platforms and services, enabling a more interconnected and personalized digital experience. By embracing data composability, users can harness the full potential of their data, creating synergies between different applications and unlocking new possibilities.</p>\r\n<p>Similarly, data portability emphasizes users’ right to access and transfer their data between different platforms and services. It enables individuals to maintain ownership and control over their personal information, promoting transparency and empowering users to decide how their data is utilized. Data portability enables seamless transitions between platforms, reducing vendor lock-in and fostering a more user-centric approach.</p>\r\n<h1>ERC-6551 NFTs enable transactions, dApp interactions, token holding, and more</h1>\r\n<p>ERC-6551 is a new standard that improves the capabilities of NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. It overcomes the limitations of the previous standard, ERC-721, which restricted NFTs from interacting with smart contracts, owning additional assets, and adapting to changing needs. By introducing ERC-6551, Ethereum expands the possibilities for NFTs and enables them to be used in new and exciting ways.</p>\r\n<p>With the deployment of the <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551\">Ethereum Improvement Proposal 6551 (EIP-6551)</a> on May 7, 2023, ERC-6551 introduces a concept called <strong>Token-Bound Accounts (TBAs)</strong>. Meaning each ERC-721 token can now have its own smart contract wallet, which allows NFTs to perform transactions, interact with decentralized applications, hold other tokens or NFTs, and even establish their on-chain identity.</p>\r\n<p>The adoption of ERC-6551 significantly expands the functionality of NFTs, making them more versatile and valuable. NFTs with ERC-6551 can now engage in transactions, collaborate with various programs, hold a diverse range of assets, and even serve as unique identifiers on the blockchain. ERC-6551 can transform into a non-custodial comprehensive wallet that gives the individual complete ownership, transaction tracking, and utility records.</p>\r\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"https://medium.com/charged-particles/erc-6551-what-three-years-building-nft-smart-wallets-has-taught-us-e26e990df29a\">article</a>, NFT Composability Expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robsecord\">Rob Secord</a> highlights the drawbacks associated with ERC-6551 technology. One concern is the manipulation of upgradeable NFT contracts, which allows the contract owner to gain ownership of all NFTs and withdraw their assets. Another risk is the absence of proper time locks, enabling assets to be drained from an NFT just before a sale, resulting in an empty NFT for the buyer. To mitigate these risks, thorough security audits are necessary during the implementation of ERC-6551. Additionally, the lack of standardization and multiple implementations make it challenging for users to understand the features and capabilities of different “Smart Wallets” linked to their NFTs. Therefore, developers and users must be vigilant about these risks, take necessary precautions, and prioritize security to safeguard against potential exploits.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lomads.xyz/\">Lomads</a>, is actively exploring ERC-6551 to implement NFT wallet solution that further enhances the user experience of the platform. Recognizing the potential risks involved, Lomads is committed to implementing appropriate measures to mitigate any issues related to upgradeable NFT contracts and asset draining.</p>\r\n<h1>EIP-5173 NFTs offer ongoing profit potential to past owners, even after selling their tokens</h1>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5173\">EIP-5173</a> is a multigenerational reward mechanism that can reward previous NFTs owners. It proposes a profit-sharing framework called nFR for EIP-721 tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. This framework allows previous NFT owners to benefit from future price increases even after selling their tokens. By introducing a giving circle concept, participants collaborate to build greater wealth through each other’s success. The FR implementation ensures that both buyers and sellers receive future rewards, fostering a fair and mutually beneficial economic rule.</p>\r\n<p>The motivation behind this proposal is to address unfair trading practices and create a <strong>more equitable system for all market participants</strong>. In traditional trading, average traders often face challenges due to asymmetry of information and techniques employed by various actors, leading to losses by the majority of traders.</p>\r\n<p>The nFR framework aims to level the playing field by establishing a giving circle where participants contribute to each other’s success. Through this framework, NFT owners can participate in a gift-economy model, similar to the open-source spirit, fostering community interdependence and shared benefits.</p>\r\n<p>The nFR proposal sets a standard interface for profit sharing throughout the token’s ownership history. It incentivizes traders to actively engage in the token’s price discovery process. By tracking transactions and recording price changes, the nFR framework aims to ensure that the value of NFTs reflects the contributions made by their owners.</p>\r\n<p>This transparent approach discourages unfair practices and encourages transparency and fairness. It is important to note that the nFR framework is not a Ponzi scheme, as it distributes profits only when they are achieved, and future return shares depend on actual profits made by subsequent token holders. <strong>By embracing EIP-5173, NFTs become more than collectibles, gaining an additional layer of value and promoting a collaborative and fair trading environment within the Ethereum ecosystem.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lomads is thrilled about the potential of EIP-5173 and will soon start working towards offering its customers the option to launch and utilize these NFTs in the upcoming months.</p>",

    "content": "<p>Pathway to making web3 more inclusive to a wide spectrum of users</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>\r\n<p>The world of blockchain technology is constantly evolving, and one concept that has been gaining significant attention is ‘account abstraction’.</p>\r\n<p>This paradigm shift allows for programmable blockchain accounts, where smart contracts exclusively hold assets, removing the need for externally-owned accounts (EOAs) to initiate and control transactions on behalf of users.</p>\r\n<p>Account abstraction opens up a realm of possibilities, empowering developers to create sophisticated wallets and innovative transactions.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s delve into the exciting use cases of account abstraction and discover how <a href=\"https://www.lomads.co/\"><strong>Lomads</strong></a> stands to benefit from this transformative approach.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Unlocking the Potential of Account Abstraction</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Account abstraction introduces numerous use cases that revolutionize the way we interact with blockchain systems. Let’s explore some of the key features:</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*pqZfuExG4MgRjGb_tOFOOQ\" width=\"700\" height=\"632\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*pqZfuExG4MgRjGb_tOFOOQ.png\"></p>Use cases of Account Abstraction\r\n<p>Most of the use cases presented above can be implemented right-away, thanks to services such as <a href=\"https://www.biconomy.io/\"><strong>Biconomy</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://web3auth.io/\"><strong>Web3Auth</strong></a>, two of Lomads’ partners. Several account abstraction features such as option for social login and gasless transactions are already implemented in Lomads and we are confident that it is going to find wide-spread use.</p>\r\n<p>A case in point, Visa, the world’s second-largest card payment organization, has released a <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/solutions/crypto/auto-payments-for-self-custodial-wallets.html\"><strong>technical paper</strong></a> discussing the need for improved user experiences and functionality in blockchain-based products. They propose a solution using Account Abstraction, a concept from Ethereum, to enable automated programmable payments. The paper highlights the challenge of setting up recurring payments on a blockchain and introduces the idea of delegable accounts, which allow users to delegate payment instructions to a pre-approved smart contract. It also mentions the implementation of Account Abstraction on StarkNet, a Layer 2 blockchain built on Ethereum. Visa sees auto payments as a crucial feature that the current blockchain infrastructure lacks and believes that programmable money and payments offer exciting opportunities.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Lomads Harnessing the Power of Account Abstraction</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Lomads acknowledges the power of account abstraction and is proactively positioning itself to capitalize on this technology. Our strategy draws on two critical insights from over 100 observed organizations:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>As the market shifts from early adopters to early majority, we detect a desire for improved user experience and a resolution to the web2 versus web3 debate.</li>\r\n  <li>In web3 organizations, a disconnect exists between forward-thinkers and the broader community, underlining the challenge of sustaining innovation that appeals to all users.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Embracing account abstraction, Lomads aims to deliver an unmatched, user-friendly experience to a diverse range of users. Here’s how:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li><strong>User-Friendly Onboarding:</strong> The technology simplifies the entry point into the blockchain by replacing complex cryptographic key management with familiar identifiers such as usernames or email addresses. This lowers the barrier for newcomers to the web3 ecosystem.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Operational Ease:</strong> Account abstraction mitigates operational friction by facilitating gasless transactions. Whether conducting financial transactions, minting membership NFT/SBT, or deploying smart contracts, users can bypass the need for native coin balances. Thus, organizations can pre-pay gas fees, easing individual burden.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Effortless Account Recovery:</strong> With the influx of new users, account recovery becomes essential. Account abstraction enables easy recovery via traditional methods like email-based resets and multi-factor authentication. And of course, there will be new web3 native methods that are yet to come!</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> This technology safeguards user accounts and transactions by employing robust cryptographic techniques, reducing risks associated with user errors such as incorrect fund transfers due to typos.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Interoperability and Collaboration:</strong> Account abstraction paves the way for seamless interaction across multiple dApps and platforms. It eliminates the need for separate accounts per application, simplifying collaboration and contributing to a vibrant web3 ecosystem.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>As such, by harnessing the power of account abstraction, Lomads is leading the charge in creating a secure, accessible, and collaborative web3 environment, paving the way for a more inclusive and user-friendly future in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*C7desbrnssBT8MgdZG8pvQ\" width=\"700\" height=\"570\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*C7desbrnssBT8MgdZG8pvQ.png\"></p>Account Abstraction as envisioned by Generative AI",

    "content": "<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalomeBernhart\"><strong>Salome Bernhart</strong></a></p>\r\n<p>The increasing legal scrutiny of DAOs highlights the importance of authentic decentralization. In the current environment, merely wrapping a DAO in one or more legal structures without achieving true decentralization can result in serious legal consequences. The distinction between a genuine DAO and a “fake” DAO, which only mimics decentralization, has become crucial for legal protection. However, current regulations do not provide clear guidance on how to make this distinction.</p>\r\n<p>Compliance and long-term viability of a DAO involve dispersing decision-making authority and resource allocation among a wide range of participants. This not only bolsters the organization’s legitimacy, but also reduces the likelihood of legal issues arising, and in many cases improves Tokenomics.</p>\r\n<p>DAOs must carefully consider the legal wrappers they choose. Legal structures can offer varying levels of protection and compliance depending on the jurisdiction in which they operate and the reason they are being used. Therefore, it is crucial that DAOs consult with legal experts to determine the most suitable legal wrappers for their specific circumstances. Regrettably, the majority of legal advisors tend to specialize in a single jurisdiction, while the inherent nature and reach of DAOs are global in scope. This presents a challenge in locating highly skilled legal professionals who possess not only a deep understanding of blockchain technology but also comprehensive expertise in international law.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A Shift in Legal Perspective</strong></p>\r\n<p>The legal landscape surrounding DAOs has shifted significantly over the past few years. MiCA regulation is currently a hot topic in the space, and it’s crucial for web3 structures to understand its parameters. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a discussion paper on crypto-assets and stablecoins, inviting views from the industry and public on the relevant regulatory approach. In the U.S. lawmakers have so far failed to get a comprehensive policy framework relating to crypto and digital assets passed, leading to what many are calling a “war” between the industry and regulators.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220613IPR32840/cryptocurrencies-in-the-eu-deal-struck-between-parliament-and-council\">The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA)</a> regulations are part of a comprehensive legislative proposal introduced by the European Commission to provide a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-assets across the European Union (EU). The aim of the MiCA regulations is to promote innovation, protect investors, and maintain financial stability by addressing potential risks associated with the use and trading of digital assets.</p>\r\n<p>The MiCA regulations cover a wide range of aspects related to crypto-assets, including their issuance, trading, and service provision. They establish clear definitions for different types of crypto-assets, such as asset-referenced tokens, electronic money tokens, and utility tokens, and outline specific requirements for each category. The framework also addresses aspects like anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and the licensing and supervision of crypto-asset service providers. Furthermore, it includes provisions related to stablecoins, with a particular emphasis on significant asset-referenced tokens and electronic money tokens, which may pose systemic risks.</p>\r\n<p>In Europe, crypto projects must ensure compliance with GDPR and carefully assess their data collection, processing, and storage practices, and implement appropriate measures to protect personal data.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What about NFTs?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lomads has just launched its awesome <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lomads_co/status/1657444861413343232\">Membership Soulbound Token (SBT) machine</a>. This nifty product module makes it super easy for organizations to sell membership SBTs, even to folks who don’t have a wallet or crypto. These SBTs are a perfect fit for cases like alumni clubs or wellness clubs where the reputation or roles earned shouldn’t be transferable to others. As we implemented this solution, the team made sure to dive into the legal implications of selling SBTs, which essentially function as NFTs.</p>\r\n<p>The categorization of NFTs under the proposed MiCA legislation is currently unclear, leading to uncertainty for issuers and businesses involved in NFTs. While certain provisions imply that NFTs should be outside MiCA’s scope, another provision suggests that if NFTs are part of a sizable series or collection, their non-fungible status could be questioned, possibly placing them under MiCA. This would subject NFT collection issuers to the same disclosure and compliance requirements intended for financial instrument issuers, and those building NFT collection marketplaces, custodians, or aggregators could be deemed MiCA crypto-asset service providers.</p>\r\n<p>After all, it remains unclear whether a standard NFT profile-picture collection will be deemed to have been issued in a sizable series or collection by regulators. Moreover, this raises interesting questions regarding technology neutrality, particularly in instances where NFT collections represent tickets, in-game assets, audio or text files and digital autographs as they may be considered regulated financial instruments in the token form under MiCA, but not in their analogue or existing digital versions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Prioritise innovation in a (today’s) legally compliant way</strong></p>\r\n<p>While Web3 prioritizes innovation and creativity, it cannot overlook the importance of operating legally. Companies will be hesitant to interact with Web3 projects that do not have a legal structure, and this limits DAO’s growth potential.</p>\r\n<p>Every DAO needs to decide how compliant they wish to be and which legal wrapper(s) would best serve their needs. While some DAOs may choose to remain regime-less, others may opt for a more traditional legal structure that enables them to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds. See further sources here from <a href=\"https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/dao-legal-entity-how-to-pick/\">a16z</a> and from <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/06/dao-strategy-and-legal-wrappers\">Paradigm</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*pxEBgWxMctvHyTR6p12W6A\" width=\"700\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*pxEBgWxMctvHyTR6p12W6A.png\"></p>Image 1: <a href=\"https://legalnodes.com/article/choose-a-crypto-friendly-country-for-dao\">Legalnodes</a>\r\n<p>In the pursuit of legal compliance, it’s crucial not to impair members’ privacy, DAO-2-DAO integrations, growth, and innovation by adding legal friction points or bottlenecks. Any legal structure should not change the current relationship between the governance framework and its existing ecosystem, and should not create any impediments to the evolution of the protocol or add stress to the current governance model.</p>\r\n<p>Having a legal framework provides a sense of security, can help attract more investment and facilitate partnerships, which in turn brings more safety and value to its contributors. Quality contributors are more likely to join Web3 structures with a clear legal framework, as it protects their interests, provides legal recourse in case of any disputes, and facilitates interaction with other companies and institutions.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, by embracing transparency, accountability and a healthy dose of legal expertise, Web3 organizations can traverse the winding path toward financial sustainability with confidence. As we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space, it’s essential to remember the importance of enjoying the journey and celebrating our achievements along the way.</p>\r\n<p>— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lomads.xyz/\">Lomads</a> offers a one-of-a-kind platform that combines workflow automation tools and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to help organizations manage capital and talent in one place.

    "content": "<p><strong>Author:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SalomeBernhart\">Salome Bernhart</a></p>\r\n<p>In the fast-paced world of blockchain and Web3 organizations, the crypto industry continuously evolves, and uncertainty is ever-present. This article explores the crucial nature of mission statements and organizational memory in Web3. We discuss the importance of a well-aligned communication system and the role of AI in aiding organizational memory.</p>\r\n<p>The research that we have conducted shows that the importance of a well-defined and effectively communicated mission statement cannot be understated in Web3. The rapidly evolving landscape poses significant challenges to the success and sustainability of these organizations. A strong mission statement helps to establish the organization’s strategic direction and community values. Additionally, maintaining organizational memory is crucial for onboarding new members, ensuring that the organization can learn from past decisions and maintain a sense of continuity despite personnel changes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Role of Mission Statements in Web3 Organizations and DAOs</strong></p>\r\n<p>A well-defined mission statement serves as a guiding light, keeping stakeholders focused and steering the organization toward its core purpose. In the early stages of Web3 organizations, some degree of centralization is often necessary, as humans have always sought direction and leadership in their social structures, especially in times of experimentation and uncertainty. This leadership is crucial for communities to function effectively, especially in the initial stages of a project.</p>\r\n<p>Effective Communication Strategies for Mission Statements</p>\r\n<p>To avoid misinterpretations and conflicts, it is essential to effectively communicate the mission and ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page, during all different stages of development of the project. Some strategies for effective communication include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Keeping the mission statement simple and concise.</li>\r\n  <li>Making the mission statement visible on various communication platforms.</li>\r\n  <li>Including the mission statement during onboarding and reiterating the mission statement regularly.</li>\r\n  <li>Encouraging open dialogue to clarify bottlenecks and friction points.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Organizational Memory in DAOs</strong></p>\r\n<p>Organizational memory refers to the need to retain and share information about the organization’s history, decisions, and processes. This information can be challenging to maintain in a DAO, <strong>where members come and go frequently, and decision-making is decentralized</strong>. Maintaining organizational memory is essential for the long-term success of a DAO, as it helps to ensure that the organization remains cohesive and effective over time.</p>\r\n<p>AI Solutions for Maintaining Organizational Memory</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*z32BJIpDkXmH5_a1LF4naA\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:500/1*z32BJIpDkXmH5_a1LF4naA.png\"></p>\r\n<p>As of today, DAOs are aware that keeping good documentation is crucial and now new tools have emerged to support these efforts. AI can be used to bridge information gaps and help members manage the DAO’s organizational memory more effectively. Some potential AI use cases include:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Knowledge graph: Maps out the organization’s history, decisions, and processes, helping members visualize the relationships between different pieces of information.</li>\r\n  <li>Chatbot: Answers questions about the organization’s history, decisions, and processes, helping new members quickly get up to speed.</li>\r\n  <li>Natural language processing system: Parses and categorizes information in the organization’s knowledge base, making it easier for members to search for and find relevant information.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Aligning Individual Contributions and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\r\n<p>A clear mission statement helps align individual contributions with the organization’s overall objectives, encourages members to consider how their efforts support the mission and help identify areas where they can make a greater impact. Establishing a strong culture of collaboration and teamwork can ensure that everyone’s efforts are channeled toward the common goal. Implementing consensus-building frameworks that encourage respectful dialogue, mutual understanding, and compromise can help diffuse tensions and maintain harmony.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pioneering Change — Harnessing AI and DAO Insights for a New Era of Management</strong></p>\r\n<p>The next generation of management tools must harness the potential of technologies, such as AI, and incorporate lessons learned from the pioneering DAOs to revolutionize organizational structures. By crafting a well-defined mission statement, these tools can guide projects towards a clear purpose that unifies and motivates team members. Furthermore, AI-driven communication strategies will streamline information sharing, promoting transparency and fostering collaboration across teams. To maximize efficiency and productivity, these advanced tools should align individual contributions with the organization’s overarching goals, tailoring tasks to match the skill sets and strengths of each member. Lastly, leveraging insights from DAOs, next-gen management tools should prioritize dispute resolution, fostering an inclusive environment that encourages diverse perspectives while equitably addressing conflicts within the community. This holistic approach to organizational management will pave the way for more agile, adaptive, and resilient enterprises in a rapidly evolving business landscape.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lomads.xyz/\">Lomads</a> offers a one-of-a-kind platform that combines workflow automation tools and <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4973\">Soulbound Tokens</a> (SBTs) to help organizations manage capital and talent in one place.

As the go-to workflow automation tooling platform for Web3 projects and DAOs, we streamline processes and save time for Polygon organizations.</p>\r\n<p>The main reasons we chose to launch on Polygon are our alignment with Polygon’s values and their dedication to innovation.</p>\r\n<p>When we were deciding on which network to launch Lomads, we needed a blockchain that prioritized consumer facing applications, making Web3 more accessible, and being environmentally conscious. Polygon fit both of these criteria perfectly as they have partnered with many major Web2 companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks. Additionally, Polygon is carbon neutral which aligns with Lomads’ mission to create a positive impact on the world and help develop regenerative finance (ReFi) projects.</p>\r\n<p>What sets Polygon ahead of the competition and shows they are ahead of the curve is their tenacity for innovating. Polygon Proof-of-Stake (POS) leads in terms of weekly transactions, NFT transactions, and NFT contract addresses created for any. It’s due to this that Lomads wants to not only be a part of such a powerful ecosystem, but wants to actively help it to thrive.</p>\r\n<p>At Lomads, we don’t just talk about the underlying values of Web3 — we live and breathe them in everything we do, from our product to our business model. Our mission is to bring the benefits of Web3 to the masses, and we’re proud to take our first step towards achieving that goal with our collaboration with Polygon:</p>\r\n<p>1. We are obsessed with user experience: By creating an optimized tooling platform that reduces cognitive load and only shows you what you need. These types of designs are paramount to bring the benefits of Web3 to the masses.</p>\r\n<p>2. Our business model is in sync with the values of Web3:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Unlike other web3 organisation tools that are set up as typical SaaS, we prioritize openness and transparency, and that’s why most of our platform is open-source. Our customers can easily build additional functionalities on top of the components we provide, giving them more control and flexibility.</li>\r\n  <li>We also believe in sharing the wealth and opportunities we create with our customers and value creators. That’s why we have set up lomads to progressively decentralise and assume a life of its own.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>3. We’re dedicated to helping Web3 organizations achieve self-sufficiency: We believe that there isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to centralization or decentralization. Instead, we know that the best solution for an organization is unique to their specific needs. Regardless of the type of organization, we are convinced that Web3’s enhanced capital coordination and asset and activity tokenization can provide significant benefits.</p>\r\n<p>Again, we are immensely excited to be collaborating with Polygon and to contribute to the growth of the entire ecosystem. Whether you’re striving for complete decentralization, or a more centralized approach, we’re here to support and guide you on your unique journey.</p>\r\n<p><strong>About Lomads:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lomads is a workflow automation platform focused on streamlining transactions and permissions for organizations. Lomads provides a range of tools for Web3 projects and DAOs that automate various processes such as: recurring payments, milestone-based payments, bounties, and batch payments. The tools also increase transparency and seamless team onboarding and management which saves projects time and money while reducing the risk of errors.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://lomads.xyz/\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/lomads/\"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lomads_co\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> | <a href=\"https://discord.gg/khxyzVyjgt\"><strong>Discord</strong></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>About Polygon Labs:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\"><strong>Polygon Labs</strong></a> <strong>develops Ethereum scaling solutions for Polygon protocols.

For example, a new organization with 5 members has vastly different priorities than a project with hundreds of contributors that has been around for multiple months.</p>\r\n<p>In this article, we will go over how to differentiate the 4 stages of Web3 projects, identify the specific needs, and detail how Lomads can assist projects at every stage.</p>\r\n<h2>Project Stages & Main Issues Faced</h2>\r\n<p>The 4 major project stages are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 1 — Hatching</strong>: The earliest project stage, Hatchings often have a well-defined end goal, but little clarity about processes and long-term stability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 2 — Nestling:</strong> This stage consists of collectives and startups with strong workflows. Nestlings usually have received small funding and have some established processes, but lack clarity on long-term financial viability.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 3 — Juvenile:</strong> Juvenile projects have an understanding of financial viability, and have established processes in place. Additionally, they have adequate funding or sources of revenue.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stage 4 — Adult:</strong> As the final stage for projects, Adult projects are made up of paid contributors and team members. Their workflow is verified, their smart contracts are audited, and they have secure and growing sources of revenue. They also tend to become incubators for other projects and startups.</p>\r\n<p>New projects face two major roadblocks when starting out: incorrectly identifying needs and prioritizing development steps.</p>\r\n<h1>When starting out, it’s easy to look at the leading projects in the space and try to emulate them; however, this is actually harmful to the project.</h1>\r\n<h1>This problem is only increased by many influencers and media outlets in Web3 who focus specifically on large projects; they tend to talk about DAOs in relation to the largest projects in the space instead of breaking them down by the stage.</h1>\r\n<p>By doing this, small and mid-sized organizations aren’t factored in which leads many startups to misidentify needs and next steps.</p>\r\n<h1>The other main issue for organizations comes from how they prioritize development, specifically when it comes to decentralization. Since decentralization is the first letter in DAO, many assume it should be the focus of all projects.</h1>\r\n<p>This is misleading as if a project isn’t organized or autonomous, then attempting to be decentralized will only lead to more problems. Instead, projects need to make organizing their processes and then automating them their primary objectives.</p>\r\n<p>And this is exactly what Lomads can help with.</p>\r\n<h2>How Lomads Helps Early Stage Projects</h2>\r\n<p>Lomads first came to be by noticing this crucial blind spot in the Web3 and DAO space.</p>\r\n<p>Lomads is geared towards Nestling stage projects; these projects have received initial funding, built a core team, and acquired contributors. Their main needs revolve around having efficient workflow tooling to organize and automate processes.</p>\r\n<p>By using Lomads’ workflow automation, Nestling projects can organize their workspaces and tasks, automate treasury and payments management to save time and money, and set up processes to reward early contributors with future funding.</p>",

According to a <a href=\"https://blog.axway.com/life-axway/customer-experience/global-consumer-survey#:~:text=some%20key%20findings.-,Convenience%20is%20still%20a%20major%20factor%20in%20consumer%20behavior,means%20a%20better%20user%20experience.\">consumer survey from Axway</a>:</p>\r\n<p>“…almost 60% of people believe it’s worth allowing companies to access their personal data if it means a better user experience.”</p>\r\n<p>While this access to user data is crucial to providing an optimal and engaging user experience, there are downsides to collecting and storing user data. Namely when it comes to privacy, security, ethical, and legal considerations. This is especially true when it comes to Blockchains which by principle are completely transparent and public.</p>\r\n<p>Any and all information stored on a blockchain is is open for anyone to have a look. So how can we ensure confidentiality of user data in Web3?</p>\r\n<h1>Optimal Encryption of User Data</h1>\r\n<p>Bridging security and anonymity is one of the major challenges in Web3. As <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-storage-offers-security-but-leaves-data-transparent\">Chainanalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin</a> said:</p>\r\n<p>“The two extremes of total anonymity and complete transparency are bad. Complete anonymity opens the door to illicit activity… On the other hand, complete transparency means no privacy at all.”</p>\r\n<p>At Lomads, user data storage and security is one of our top priorities; we aim to implement a security system that enables data owners access to their personal information to use and share at their own discretion to limit any openings for potential security risks.</p>\r\n<p>For this purpose, we are using Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, to encrypt sensitive user data. An example of this is with Soulbound Token (SBT) Metadata, and the process is illustrated below:</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*CdbFKr1dAUi5_am-ZkXVtg\" width=\"700\" height=\"250\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*CdbFKr1dAUi5_am-ZkXVtg.png\"></p>Process of Asymmetric Cryptography\r\n<p>Asymmetric cryptography uses two different keys: the public key (available for anyone to use) and private key (known to the user only). Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key. This allows data to be encrypted before being inserted on the blockchain and ensures only the owner of the data can decrypt and access the data!</p>\r\n<p>For more Web3 insights and updates, be sure to follow on Medium & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lomads_co\">Twitter</a> for all our updates & announcements!</p>",

Is this the beginning of the end?” They raised similar concerns to what function NFTs will have in the future:</p>\r\n<p>So, does NFT have a future, or is it a passing fad? What are the potential NFT directions and trends we will see in 2023?</p>\r\n<p>Through all of the questions and worry, NFTs as a technology are here to stay and their main function will be providing utility in Web3.</p>\r\n<h1>Utility NFTs</h1>\r\n<p>One of the key criticisms of NFTs has been the lack of practical usage.</p>\r\n<p>This has given them a dodgy reputation and has made people doubt the perseverance of the NFT technology. Going forward users expect additional value and functionality from their NFTs which will guide how NFTs are valued.</p>\r\n<p>This unique feature of adding utility to NFT projects is most likely going to thrive in 2023.</p>\r\n<p>Projects are looking to use NFTs, not just as fun pictures you can use on social media, but as versatile and sustainable tokens in daily life. The added utility will increase the value of NFTs while at the same time increasing the usability of blockchain technology by exploring new ways to use NFTs in real life.</p>\r\n<p>Depending on the project the utility of each NFT can be different.</p>\r\n<p>We will see more and more NFT related projects in 2023 that will use NFTs as for utility and advantages as opposed to only having NFTs for digital art pieces. These advantages include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>access to physical world such as events or products or discounts</li>\r\n  <li>enter into agreements with others for goods and services</li>\r\n  <li>access to various apps and content such as gaming, usage of features</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are numerous examples of utility NFTs being used with Web3 and Metaverse organizations. <a href=\"https://www.iyk.app/drops/gmi\">GMI Hoodie</a> combines both digital and physical ownership rights in one place. Users can buy physical hoodies that can be sacnned upon receipt to obtain both a NFT and $1 in GMI tokens. If an owners resells the hoodie, the NFT is transferred to the new owner to prove ownership.</p>\r\n<p>Another great example is a project called <a href=\"https://robotera.io/?clickId=fx_b18615_d2ef598d5cd6eb069b2ccdf5cb3e1ae4_1#/pre-sale?lang=en\">RobotEra</a> which bridges NFTs, Play-to-Earn gaming, and Metaverse in one platform. By owning a RobotEra NFT, users earn special benefits within the game.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, we have already seen real world cases of established, traditional companies building utility NFTs into their product offering. One of the most famous examples from 2022 is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/08/new-alfa-romeo-suv-equipped-with-nft-blockchain-technology.html\">Alfa Romeo including a NFT with their Tonale SUV</a>. This NFT records vehicle data to assure the car has been properly maintained to help provide transparency to the current and future car owners.</p>\r\n<p>Examples like these will only continue to increase in 2023 as we are seeing Fortune 500 Companies, such as <a href=\"https://101blockchains.com/top-tech-firms-investing-in-web-3-0/\">Starbucks, Disney, and Coca-Cola, expand to Web3.</a></p>\r\n<h1>Lomads & Utility NFTs</h1>\r\n<p>At Lomads, Utility NFTs are built into the core of our product offering in the form of <a href=\"/@lomads/soulbound-tokens-overview-utilities-fe30deddc0a2\">Soulbound Tokens (SBT)</a> which hold the key to automated permission less rights and access control.</p>\r\n<p>Soulbound Token ownership along with the metadata stored in the SBT will unlock different utilities within the organizational ecosystem like:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Access to 3rd party apps like Notion and Discord</li>\r\n  <li>Access to Treasury Management Functions to:</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Create transactions to distribute funds</li>\r\n  <li>Sign and Approve Transactions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>3. Access to Operations related functions</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Create Projects and Teams</li>\r\n  <li>Create and Review Tasks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Additionally, the utility of Lomads Soulbound Tokens will increase in the future.

This encryption and storage covers both customer data and Soulbound Token (SBT) metadata!</p>\r\n<p>See below for more details on why we chose these technologies, why decentralized storage is important, and how you, the customer, will benefit from their implementation.</p>\r\n<h1>Centralized vs. Decentralized Storage</h1>\r\n<p>In today's data driven digital world the amount of data collected by social media media websites and internet browsers in mind boggling.</p>\r\n<p>Sadly 90% of all web traffic data is centralized among top 5 companies and hence subject to their internal policies and rules. In Q2 of 2022, <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC (<strong>International Data Corporation)</strong></a> conducted a Cloud Storage Survey to better understand the drawbacks and limitations of the existing Web2-based cloud storage providers. The results were eye-opening:</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"1*fWR-w1Mq7gvGLJpEC362KA\" width=\"700\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*fWR-w1Mq7gvGLJpEC362KA.png\"></p>Results of IDC’s Cloud Storage Survey by <a href=\"https://www.idc.com/\">IDC</a>\r\n<p>With the vast issues centralized storage faces, decentralized storage has become the go-to solution for reliability, scalability, and security. As Daniel Norman, developer advocate at IPFS said,</p>\r\n<p>Centralized storage is limited to a small number of providers, limiting pricing and efficiency, and very little interoperability, leading to consumer lock-in…storage is costly, and it is not always verifiable and immutable. This is why a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for storing information is needed.”</p>\r\n<p>Web3 proposes a new “decentralized” model of data storage which promises to be more liberal and privacy-centric.</p>\r\n<p>It aims to enable anyone to use digital services without having to reveal their personal data to companies that would monetize it, thereby putting control with the data owners.</p>\r\n<p>The decentralized model transfers authority from a central power to a more localized and ‘liberal’ system by spreading the hosting of files i.e. storing data across multiple computers also known as nodes which are connected together on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.</p>\r\n<p>This helps in protecting the integrity, accessibility, and security of data. In addition to these positives, the cost of storage has proven to be beyond <a href=\"https://dataonboarding.filecoin.io/\">95% lower on a per-gigabyte basis</a> than today’s market rates for Web2-based public cloud storage providers (and can even be free in some cases).</p>\r\n<h1>Why IPFS & Filecoin?</h1>\r\n<p>We have chosen to use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) & Filecoin via Protocol Labs, a leader in Web3 storage, to maximize Lomads’ decentralized data storage potential.</p>\r\n<p>IPFS is a Protocol Labs project that has created a new way for storing and retrieving information on the web. Rather than using the traditional approach of location based addressing, (where is the data), IPFS uses <a href=\"https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/\">content addressing</a> (what is the data). This preserves the integrity of data and ensures long-term data persistence and immutability.</p>\r\n<p>Filecoin is an incentive layer on top of IPFS; it works by rewarding nodes to keep data storage in perpetuity. By doing this, Filecoin has created a whole new economy around incentive based, decentralized storage through networking. Currently, Filecoin is able to reliably service over 1 billion weekly data retrieval calls.</p>\r\n<p>With the dramatic improvements IPFS & Filecoin have in scalability, reliability, decentralization, and cost-reduction, they have solved many of the problems Web2 cloud storage faces all while creating a sustainable and profitable network.</p>\r\n<h1>Benefits for Customers</h1>\r\n<p>Lomads is using these technologies for off-chain data storage as we believe in privacy and security above all else.</p>\r\n<p>IPFS & Filecoin gives us the ability to protect user data without compromising privacy and autonomy. Additionally, IPFS provides robust data backups to drastically reduce the chance of server failure and give customers peace of mind.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, we will be using IPFS to store the following organization data:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Projects and Tasks</li>\r\n  <li>Transactions (payments, salaries, transfers etc.)</li>\r\n  <li>Soulbound Token (SBT) Metadata</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be sure to follow our Medium Page, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/64256997/admin/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BM6Sajyx1Qe%2BKIkuEk6rkfQ%3D%3D\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lomads_co\">Twitter</a> for all Lomads updates & announcements!</p>"

In this article, we go through what utilities SBTs can have, and how they will function in Lomads Dashboard to create an optimal and secure user experience.</p>\r\n<h1>What are Soulbound Tokens?</h1>\r\n<p>Soulbound Tokens are non-transferable digital tokens that represent an immutable identity on the blockchain.</p>\r\n<p>They can’t be bought or sold and are most commonly used to provide certifications, symbolize an accomplishment, or build reputations. Proposed examples of how to use SBTs include managing medical records, certifying educational degrees, and verifying job history or professional qualifications.</p>\r\n<p>Within the realm of Web3, there are many more proposed use cases for SBTs including DAO membership and anonymous identity verification.</p>\r\n<h1>How will Lomads Dashboard use Soulbound Tokens?</h1>\r\n<p>Lomads will implement SBTs for 3 major functions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Single access token across 3rd party tools</li>\r\n  <li>Personalized dashboard & data ownership</li>\r\n  <li>Immutable record of contributions</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Single Access Token Across 3rd Party Tools</h2>\r\n<p>Using Lomads, you can roll our SBTs into your organization without having to write a single line of code!</p>\r\n<p>Your SBT will serve as an access token to 3rd party tools, such as Notion & Discord, and allow for maximized interoperability.</p>\r\n<h2>Personalized Dashboard & Data Ownership</h2>\r\n<p>Each organization will have their own SBTs for their respective members.</p>\r\n<p>This will allow for easy permission & task assignments, and allows every member to retain ownership of his/her own personal data.</p>\r\n<h2>Immutable Record of Contributions</h2>\r\n<p>Each organization’s SBT will record what contributions each member is making towards a project.</p>\r\n<p>This not only improves transparency, but build members’ accountability and credibility over time.</p>\r\n<p>The addition of Soulbound Tokens in Lomads Dashboard will not only allow for optimal user experience and permissions management, but also allows for secure and efficient storage of metadata.</p>\r\n<p>For more Web3 insights and updates, Be sure to follow our Medium Page, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/64256997/admin/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_feed%3BM6Sajyx1Qe%2BKIkuEk6rkfQ%3D%3D\">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lomads_co\">Twitter</a> for all Lomads updates & announcements!</p>",

The COVID pandemic showed that for most industries, work can be flexible. Countries have started to roll out special digital nomad visas, the most recent being Spain. More and more of Generation Z are opting for freelance work.</p>\r\n<p>This major shift in our generation’s behaviour coincides with breakthroughs in technology, which are enabling trustless collaboration, easy capital pooling and deployment, and personal data ownership. We have seen great experiments in the space, but the tools currently available only marginally improve what already exists in web2, and provide a very clunky user experience.</p>\r\n<p>It’s time to reimagine the tools for the new work and provide the most seemless user experience.</p>\r\n<p>Meet <a href=\"https://lomads.xyz/\"><strong>Lomads</strong></a> <strong>— The Primary Dashboard of Web3 Organisations 💰 Coordinate Capital | 🛡️ Build Accountability | ⚓ Streamline Decisions</strong></p>\r\n<p>Join our closed beta and be part of the excitement of reimagining a better future of work — where autonomy meets accountability, where capital seamlessly flows to sources of value creation, and where dreams for a better future are met!</p>\r\n<h1>Not a dream anymore, it’s here</h1>\r\n<p>Lomads is live on <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">Polygon</a>!</p>\r\n<p>Have you wanted to join a web3 organization, a DAO, start a working group between friends, or find a way to pool and distribute funds easily and trustlessly? Lomads offers you a <strong>unified dashboard,</strong> packed with all the features you need to set up your organization, there whenever you need them, throughout the organization’s evolutionary process.</p>\r\n<p>“Ah! I have seen my fair share of tools that promise to do something similar.”</p>\r\n<p>There are a few things that are distinctly different about Lomads.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Imagine you want to have a large scotch on the rocks?! And you have to go to one bar to get a glass, another one to get ice cubes, and yet another to finally get your scotch! That’s how things are today with respect to tools for organizations. You do your work at one place, evaluate the performance at another, make payments for different types of work (bounties, recurring payments, milestone-based) at another, and take and record key decisions at yet another . <strong>There is no single source of truth.</strong> How can you align an organization of 50+ people? <strong>And of course, if you are a core contributor, you will be drowned in administrative work and more prone to making errors.</strong> We hear you! We have heard this over and over again.</li>\r\n  <li>Let’s try a quick game. Go to any tool or platform designed for web3 organizations (incl. DAOs) and see how much time it takes for you to figure out what’s going on, and what the key priorities of the organization are. When your organization uses Lomads, it should take <strong>less than 7 seconds</strong> to know what is occurring in your organization and what is required of you. Try it! What we are building is not another productivity tool. It’s the place where you see the sources of value creation (tasks, departments, sub-DAOs) and the key contributors, and manage the flow of capital among these. <strong>That’s the only way you can run a viable organization in the web3 economy.</strong> If you are a contributor to several organizations, you can clearly see the effort you are putting in and the resulting earnings. <strong>That’s the only way you will get the most out of your work life.</strong></li>\r\n</ol>Sneak Peek Video\r\n<p>The treasury is built on Gnosis Safe, there are Soul Bound Tokens that personalize your dashboard, capture your contribution, and do more…. But that’s for another time! We are not here to flash tech at you. You are the hero in our story.</p>\r\n<h1>Be part of the game</h1>\r\n<p>The Lomads platform is currently live, open in a closed beta in the form of cohort feedback groups.</p>\r\n<p>We welcome and reward your feedback!
