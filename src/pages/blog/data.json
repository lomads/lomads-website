The NFTs, conceptualized by our team, symbolize the interconnected, dynamic balance that are the hallmarks of nature in its purest form.</p>\r\n<p>These are the aspects that inspire us as we build tools for next-gen organizations.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond representing inspirational ideas, these limited edition NFTs have several utilities which are listed below. Each NFT also has its own Lomads governance voting power and token allocation which are determined by its rank.</p>\r\n<h2>Lomads’ LMD Token</h2>\r\n<p>The LMD token, which will launch in Feb 2024, is the driving force behind the Lomads platform and will allow customers to access its services and shape its future. By staking LMD, you can earn staking rewards, have a say in the platform’s governance, and enjoy discounted rates on product charges. Please refer to <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/Lomads-Token-Design-Tokenomics-98f8151c6f534340beb86d56d76cb2f9\">Lomads Tokenomics</a> for more details on LMD.</p>\r\n<p>The platform will offer three pricing tiers — Free, Essential, and Pro — based on the features provided in each. Our prices will be competitive and will be revealed in the near future. Additionally, the first 30 organizations will have the opportunity to use the platform for free for a period of 6 to 12 months, depending on the NFT they are able to claim.</p>\r\n<p>We’re excited to have you as a part of our community and to offer you this opportunity as a token of our appreciation. As we all play a separate, vital role in the Lomads ecosystem, our NFTs embody and symbolize these respective roles.</p>\r\n<p>Below are the different types of NFTs along with their respective perks and criteria to be obtained.</p>\r\n<h1>NFT Tiers</h1>\r\n<h1>1.
